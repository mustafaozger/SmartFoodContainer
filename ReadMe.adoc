# 🌟 Smart Jar IoT Project

This project is a smart IoT-enabled jar using an **ESP32** development board. It automatically monitors internal humidity, temperature, and ambient light, controls a servo-based lid mechanism, and integrates with the **Arduino IoT Cloud** for real-time control and scheduling.

## ⚖️ Features

* ✔️ DHT11 sensor for **temperature & humidity** monitoring
* ✔️ LDR for **light level** detection
* ✔️ HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect approach (for lid control)
* ✔️ SG90 Servo motor for automated **jar lid opening/closing**
* ✔️ RGB LED for **visual feedback** based on humidity
* ✔️ OLED display for local sensor readouts
* ✔️ Arduino IoT Cloud integration for:

  * Live sensor data dashboard
  * Manual servo control switch (`servoEnable`)
  * Scheduled servo disable window via `scheduleActive`

## 🛠️ Hardware Components

| Component          | Quantity  |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| ESP32 DevKit V1    | 1         |
| DHT11 Sensor       | 1         |
| LDR                | 1         |
| HC-SR04 Sensor     | 1         |
| SG90 Servo Motor   | 1         |
| SH1106 OLED        | 1         |
| RGB LED            | 1         |
| Resistors          | As needed |
| Breadboard + Wires | -         |

## 💡 How It Works

* If someone approaches the jar (distance < 10 cm), the servo opens the lid
* During scheduled hours, the lid does not open even if someone is near
* Humidity level controls RGB LED:

  * Red: dry (<30%)
  * Yellow: normal (30%-60%)
  * Blue: humid (>60%)
* OLED shows current distance, temperature, humidity, and light level

## ☁️ Arduino Cloud Variables

| Variable         | Type            | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `distance`       | `float`         | Ultrasonic sensor distance (cm)         |
| `temperature`    | `float`         | From DHT11                              |
| `humidity`       | `float`         | From DHT11                              |
| `lightLevel`     | `float`         | From LDR                                |
| `servoEnable`    | `boolean`       | Manual override to enable/disable servo |
| `scheduleActive` | `CloudSchedule` | Auto-disable servo on schedule          |
